## Intelligent System for Optimal Transport and Operations of Power Elements

A Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) framework for nuclear fuel loading pattern optimization.

## Overview

ISOTOPE uses hierarchical multi-agent reinforcement learning to solve the Loading Pattern Optimization (LPO) problem in nuclear reactor cores. The goal is to optimize fuel assembly placement to maximize energy output while maintaining strict safety margins.
