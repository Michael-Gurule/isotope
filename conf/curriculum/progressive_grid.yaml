# Advancement Criteria
advancement:
  metric: "ppf_under_limit_rate"  # Fraction of episodes with PPF < 1.5
  window_size: 100  # Rolling window for metric calculation
  allow_regression: true  # Allow returning to earlier stages
  regression_threshold: 0.40  # Regress if success rate drops below this

# Stage Transition
transition:
  warmup_episodes: 50  # Episodes before advancement check
  cooldown_episodes: 100  # Episodes after advancement before next check
